## Just playing with Elm + Elixir!

It's supposed to be HackerNews applied to the layout of the famous brazilian
news portal Globo.com

If you want to run it, clone first the backend repository (it's super simple
and you will not need a database): https://github.com/leordev/hackernews-scrape

Then, clone this repository and inside the root directory run the
below commands:

```
npm install
elm-package install
gulp
```

And finally open http://localhost:4080
